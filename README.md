Contact Tracing - India

**AAROGYA SETU** - centralized solution that relies on Bluetooth + GPS/Location. It requires mobile-phone number registration. Only Indian mobile numbers are allowed - VoIP numbers are now forbidden.

There are some concerns about this app, since its adoption was initially compulsory (turned later into voluntary basis) & also because of users' data security issues (that were exposing location & personal infos).
